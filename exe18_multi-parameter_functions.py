""" Let's play with triangles now. We'll start with a function to check whether three sides of given lengths can build a triangle.

We know from school that the sum of two arbitrary sides has to be longer than the third side.

It won't be a hard challenge. The function will have three parameters â€’ one for each side.

It will return True if the sides can build a triangle, and False otherwise. In this case, is_a_triangle is a good name for such a function. """

""" In the second step, we'll try to ensure that a certain triangle is a right-angle triangle.

We will need to make use of the Pythagorean theorem:

c2 = a2 + b2

How do we recognize which of the three sides is the hypotenuse?

The hypotenuse is the longest side. """
