""" Palindromes
Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

asks the user for some text;
checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints the result.
Note:

assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
spaces are not taken into account during the check â€“ treat them as non-existent; """
